# LinqExamples
LINQ in C# is used to work with data access from sources such as objects, data sets, SQL Server, and XML.
LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query. LINQ is a data querying API with SQL like query syntaxes. LINQ provides functions to query cached data from all kinds of data sources. The data source could be a collection of objects, database or XML files. We can easily retrieve data from any object that implements the IEnumerable<T> interface.
